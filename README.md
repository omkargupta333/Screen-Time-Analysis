# Screen-Time-Analysis
To develop a screen time project that tracks the time spent on your mobile phone due to social media notifications, you can use Python along with relevant libraries and APIs. Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

Data Collection: Utilize APIs provided by social media platforms (such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) to access notification data. Retrieve information such as the timestamp of each notification.

Notification Parsing: Process the collected data to extract relevant information, including the notification type (social media), timestamp, and possibly the app name.

Time Calculation: Calculate the duration of each social media session by analyzing the time difference between consecutive notifications. Consider a session to start when a social media notification is received and end when the next notification arrives or when a certain period of inactivity occurs.

Aggregation and Visualization: Aggregate the calculated session durations and generate visualizations (such as graphs or charts) to represent the total time spent on social media due to notifications. You can use libraries like pandas, matplotlib, or seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Notification Threshold: Optionally, you can set a threshold to exclude notifications below a certain time duration (e.g., only consider sessions longer than a few minutes) to filter out shorter interruptions.

Insights and Analysis: Analyze the collected data to gain insights into your screen time patterns, such as identifying peak usage times, most frequently used apps, or trends over time.

User Interface (UI): Create a user-friendly interface that displays the screen time statistics and visualizations. This can be a web or desktop application or even a mobile app, depending on your preference and platform compatibility.

Privacy Considerations: Ensure that your project respects user privacy and adheres to applicable data protection regulations. Handle data securely and anonymize any personally identifiable information.

By following these steps, you can create a screen time project that helps you understand and monitor the time you spend on your mobile phone due to social media notifications.
